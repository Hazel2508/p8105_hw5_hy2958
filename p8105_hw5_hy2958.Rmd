#problem 1
has_duplicate_birthday <- function(n) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
}

birthday_prob_loop <- function(n, n_sim = 10000) {
  result <- logical(n_sim)  ##create all 'false' list
  for (i in 1:n_sim) {
    result[i] <- has_duplicate_birthday(n)
  }
  mean(result)
}


birthday_df <- tibble(
  group_size = 2:50,
  prob_shared = map_dbl(2:50, birthday_prob_loop)
)

#plot
birthday_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = group_size, y = prob_shared)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "Birthday Duplication Simulation",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday"
  ) 
```
The plot shows the estimated probability that at least two people in a group share the same birthday changes with the group size.

When the group size is small, the probability is close to 0, as the group size continues to increase, the probability grows quickly and approaches 1.

plot1: The plot shows a positive association between effect size (true μ) and power.
As the true mean μ moves farther from 0 (the null value), the probability of rejecting H₀ increases sharply.
When μ ≈ 0, power is low (near the nominal α = 0.05 level).
As μ increases to around 2–3, power rises quickly above 0.5, and for μ ≥ 4, power approaches 1.

plot2&3: The sample average of mu hat where the null is rejected is not approximately equal to the true value of mu

This happens because of selection bias, when we condition on statistical significance (p < 0.05), we only keep the samples with unusually large sample means (those that happened to deviate most from 0).

The raw data contains 52179 observations and 12 variables, included the location of the killing, whether an arrest was made and, in most cases, basic demographic information about each victim.
