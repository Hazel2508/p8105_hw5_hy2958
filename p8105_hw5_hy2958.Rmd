#problem 1
has_duplicate_birthday <- function(n) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
}

birthday_prob_loop <- function(n, n_sim = 10000) {
  result <- logical(n_sim)  ##create all 'false' list
  for (i in 1:n_sim) {
    result[i] <- has_duplicate_birthday(n)
  }
  mean(result)
}


birthday_df <- tibble(
  group_size = 2:50,
  prob_shared = map_dbl(2:50, birthday_prob_loop)
)

#plot
birthday_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = group_size, y = prob_shared)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "Birthday Duplication Simulation",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday"
  ) 
```
The plot shows the estimated probability that at least two people in a group share the same birthday changes with the group size.

When the group size is small, the probability is close to 0, as the group size continues to increase, the probability grows quickly and approaches 1.
